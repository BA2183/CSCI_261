Duan Nguyen - CSCI 261
1. I choose to impliment linked list since I already have some code for it that seem to work.
2. The challenge is I do not know if my program completely clean up whatever linked list is left behind.
3. I do not think so, because this program seem to only reading forward for each thing it prints.
4. My list build up by adding one element at a time.
5. The challenge for validating the file due to choice of data structure was not present at all, but rather the error of the program reading in white spaces.
6. I guess it might, but at the sametime, the comparison is bettween 3 items in the list that hold the faces.
7. There is no challenge for printing data since it is simple access of each element in a linked list.
8. I do not think so, since the access time should be similar.
